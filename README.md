Web-site for ordering pizza

I've created a full-fledged website for pizza ordering using JavaScript technologies (including Express.js for the server-side), HTML, and CSS. I've implemented user authentication, the ability to place orders, and data persistence using MongoDB. Using sessions to store data in localStorage ensures the state is preserved after page reloads.

Throughout the project, you gained experience in web application development, database handling, user request processing, and session management. Moving forward, you can delve deeper into Node.js and Express.js development, explore advanced user authentication and authorization methods, and learn modern web development practices such as using frontend frameworks and deployment automation tools.
